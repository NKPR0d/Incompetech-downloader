The fork of the program which was written several years ago on python 2.
I decided to rewrite it in python 3 with possible additions/changes.

Taken from the original readme

# incompetech-downloader

An easy-to-use command-line tool able to download music from incompetech.com.
Written in pure python, it doesn't need any dependencies, so it should work on any python 2 compatible environment.
Since I don't have much experience with python 3 it will take me some time to get it working for that. If you want to cut long things short, send me a pull request.
If you have feature requests just let me know by opening an issue or using some other way of interaction.

# how to use

call the incompetech-downloader.py script by supplying the argument --help, which will show you all command-line arguments and a brief explanation to them.

# Currently Supported Sites

I don't guarantee that this list will always be the most up-to-date one, if you want to stay  up-to-date, just checkout the repo and take a look on your own.

Anyway, these sites are supported at this time:

* audionautix.com
* freepd.com
* incompetech.com
* joshwoodward.com
* soundimage.org
* teknoaxe.com
* timbeek.com

I will try to implement a command-line parameter to list all supported sites including the supported sorting algorithms and everything else relating to them.

# issues

If you run in any, send me a ticket. I will fix it as soon as possible.
